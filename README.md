files, with this lightweight application

Image processing applications are not exactly scarce, but a complex program is not always the solution. 
If you only need to perform a straightforward, repetitive task, a simple utility is often more suitable.

4neso Rotator is a handy tool that enables you to create several modified versions of a source image file in seconds. It is easy-to-use and fully portable

Handy utility that can help you generate modified versions of an original image.

When you load an image file, 4neso Rotator creates a total of eighteen flipped or rotated variations or the picture. However, just half of these seem to be unique, as only nine distinct files can be exported.

You can click any of the generated thumbnails to analyze the image and save it separately, but it is also possible to export all the pictures all at once.


Features a strange limitation that reduces its usefulness

Lightweight application that does not need to be installed

While 4neso Rotator is far from perfect, it does have one major advantage, namely the fact that you can run it from any location without installing it on your PC beforehand.

The program does not store any data on your computer or add any entries to the registry, and you can launch it from a portable storage device on any machine that meets the listed software requirements.

Overall, 4neso Rotator is a simple utility that could be very useful if it were improved in certain respects
